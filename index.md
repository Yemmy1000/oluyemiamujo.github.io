#### [Software engineer]({{ site.baseurl }}/se) ðŸ’»
#### [Information/cyber security analyst]({{ site.baseurl }}/sec) ðŸ§°
#### [AI (ML/DL/LLM) Engineer]({{ site.baseurl }}/ai) ðŸ“¦
<br>

I can usually be found in the Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI) Lab, classroom, or in my house at a programming IDE or reading.
<br> I mentor and I am mentored:

- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713575-coders-at-work)
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
